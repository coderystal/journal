### numeric input
* not a fan of huge dropdowns - I find the scrolling annoying
* input properties to make input show as a numeric keypad on mobile:
  * works with `type` `number` or `text`  
```
<input pattern="[0-9]*" inputmode="numeric">
```
* context: find card #

### undo / history / back
* 2 history models: linear and full action (nonlinear)
  * eg full action includes undo
* already coded linear history model, considered changing to full action (nonlinear), decided not to change
  * chatgpt recommended linear history: commonly expected/implemented, nonlinear usually comes with a history tree
  * nonlinear could make the undo history incredibly long and confusing with potentially lots of duplicates
  * nonlinear would make it harder to navigate to first few cards
  * most people wouldn't undo too much, and wouldn't be trying to retraverse their steps?
  * history is already kept for reference, ordered history of nonlinear actions would add little value
  * slight con: linear intuitively would mean current card (before undo) is removed from history - but keeping it in the history is a greater priority
* context: undo, changed to back

### input styling
* attribute `size` to control input width works for `type` `text` but not `number`
* context: find card #
