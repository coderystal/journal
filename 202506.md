### numeric input
* not a fan of huge dropdowns - I find the scrolling annoying
* input properties to make input show as a numeric keypad on mobile:
  * works with `type` `number` or `text`  
```
<input pattern="[0-9]*" inputmode="numeric">
```
* context: find card #

### undo / history / back
* 2 history models: linear and full action (nonlinear)
  * eg full action includes undo
* already coded linear history model, considered changing to full action (nonlinear), decided not to change
  * chatgpt recommended linear history: commonly expected/implemented, nonlinear usually comes with a history tree
  * nonlinear could make the undo history incredibly long and confusing with potentially lots of duplicates
  * nonlinear would make it harder to navigate to first few cards
  * most people wouldn't undo too much, and wouldn't be trying to retraverse their steps?
  * history is already kept for reference, ordered history of nonlinear actions would add little value
  * slight con: linear intuitively would mean current card (before undo) is removed from history - but keeping it in the history is a greater priority
* context: undo, changed to back

### input size attribute
* attribute `size` (width - number of characters, but better to size up for mobile) to control input width works for `type` `text` but not `number`
* context: find card #

### numeric input type
* on desktop, `type=number` `input` attribute supports arrow up and down to change the values, but `type=text` does not by default
* okay with keeping text type, because I like using the size attribute, and find card # should not be used for navigating through the deck quickly, and I don't necessarily want anyone to navigate through the deck in order
* context: find card #
### font size
* `font-size` css property can be a number in any of the following units
  * fixed sizing: `px` and `em`
    * values like `xx-small` - `xxx-large` are fixed
    * `smaller` and `larger` are relative to the parent
  * responsive: `%`, `vh` (viewport height), `vw` (viewport width)
  * for use across platforms, to have text take up more space on mobile, using the following values:
    * central focus: 4vh, context: question
    * title: 5vh, context: curious convo companion
    * in general, buttons, footnotes/details: 2vh, context: everything else
* note: `font-size` property for css selector `html` does not apply to button text
### alignment
* parent style `display: flex;` + align horizontal: `justify-content: center;` + align vertical: `align-items: center;`
* context: parent = `#question`, child = `.cardq` - did not work, refer to vertical alignment with overflow and scroll
### vertical alignment with overflow and scroll
* when both parent and child have set `height` values, and child may need to use `overflow`
  * `align-items: center;` can make it impossible to scroll to the top of the child content
  * not sure, TODO: investigate
* parent style `display: flex;` + child style `margin: auto;`
  * works fine to vertically and horizontally align the child
* context: parent = `#question`, child = `.cardq`

### keyboard events
* using `onkeydown`
  * supposedly `onkeypress` is deprecated
  * e.key: character entered or for special characters: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/UI_Events/Keyboard_event_key_values
  * e.target: element that key is entered into, eg input

### informational pages
* using same card element for this game, considered and tried putting info cards in the history, but decided against. feels too messy and unnecessary
* context: about, title, instructions, coderystal
### organizing page elements
* considered and tried putting the deck dropdown on the title card, but decided against. unnecessary complexity / not intuitive to find the change deck function.
* organized buttons instead by grouping into rows
* context:
  * history: reset, back, num viewed
  * new: draw, find #
  * set: deck, num cards
### GitHub pages
* set up for the first time today! no longer using htmlpreview or html-preview
* repo > settings > pages, select deploy from a branch, select main, select root, click save
  * if setting up for the first time, select none and click save, then select main and click save, to kick off the build
* the repo needs to have a readme.md or index.html file in the root, which will be rendered at `username.github.io/reponame/`
  * unless reponame = `username.github.io`, then it will be directly rendered at that location
* note other files can be built as well, perhaps I can split up my single html file...
